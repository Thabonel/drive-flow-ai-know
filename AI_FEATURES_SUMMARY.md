# AI Meeting Prep & Task Decomposition - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Two new AI-powered features have been added to enhance productivity and meeting preparation:

1. **AI Meeting Prep** - Automatically generates comprehensive meeting briefs
2. **AI Task Decomposition** - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks

---

## ✨ Feature 1: AI Meeting Prep

### What It Does

Generates an intelligent meeting brief including:
- **Meeting Objectives** (1-3 clear goals)
- **Key Talking Points** (3-5 essential topics)
- **Questions to Prepare** (3-5 questions to consider)
- **Potential Decisions** (decisions that might need to be made)
- **Preparation Items** (things to review beforehand)
- **Suggested Duration** (realistic time estimate)
- **Confidence Score** (how confident AI is based on available context)

### Where It Appears

- **In AddItemForm**: When you mark a task as "This is a meeting", a blue gradient card appears suggesting AI prep
- **Standalone Button**: Any meeting item can trigger the prep dialog with the "✨ AI Prep" button

### How It Works

1. User creates or edits a meeting in the timeline
2. Checks the "This is a meeting" checkbox
3. Blue card appears: "Prepare for this meeting?"
4. Click "AI Prep" button
5. AI analyzes meeting title, attendees, description
6. Generates comprehensive brief in beautiful modal
7. User can regenerate if needed

### UI Features

- **Color-coded confidence badges** (Green = High, Yellow = Medium, Orange = Low)
- **Organized sections** with icons:
  - 🎯 Target icon for objectives
  - 💬 Message icon for talking points
  - ❓ Question icon for questions
  - ✓ Check icon for decisions
  - 📄 Document icon for preparation items
  - ⏱️ Clock icon for duration
- **Regenerate button** to get fresh suggestions
- **Responsive design** with max-height scrolling

### Files Created

- `src/components/ai/AIMeetingPrep.tsx` - Main component (170 lines)
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/meeting-prep.ts` - Prompt engineering (130 lines)

## 🔧 Feature 2: AI Task Decomposition

### What It Does

Breaks down complex tasks into 3-8 subtasks with:
- **Smart Task Analysis** - Identifies logical phases
- **Time Estimates** - Per subtask and total
- **Dependency Detection** - Which tasks must come first
- **Tag Assignment** - Categorizes subtasks
- **Confidence Scores** - Per subtask accuracy
- **Optional Flags** - Marks which tasks can be skipped

### Where It Appears

- **In AddItemForm**: Automatically suggests breakdown for:
  - Tasks **over 2 hours** (120 minutes)
  - Tasks with complex keywords: "prepare", "build", "create", "develop", "implement", "design", "write", "plan", "research", etc.
- **Purple gradient card** appears with suggestion

### How It Works

1. User creates a task (e.g., "Prepare Q4 board presentation")
2. System detects task is >2 hours or has complex keyword
3. Purple card appears: "Break down this task?"
4. Click "Break Down Task" button
5. AI generates subtasks with estimates
6. User can:
   - ✅ Select/deselect subtasks
   - ✏️ Edit titles and durations
   - 🗑️ Delete unwanted subtasks
   - ⬆️⬇️ Reorder with grip handles
   - ♻️ Regenerate entire breakdown
7. Click "Add to Timeline" to add selected subtasks

### UI Features

- **Interactive tree structure** with cards for each subtask
- **Drag handles** for reordering
- **Inline editing** - Edit title and duration
- **Checkbox selection** - Pick which subtasks to add
- **Confidence badges** - High/Medium/Low per subtask
- **Optional badges** - Clearly marks optional tasks
- **Dependencies display** - Shows task relationships
- **Summary stats**:
  - Total subtasks count
  - Combined time estimate
  - Overall confidence score
- **Bulk actions**: Select all / Add selected to timeline

### Advanced Features

1. **Auto-Decompose Logic** (`shouldAutoDecompose()`)
   - Duration check: >120 minutes
   - Keyword detection in title
   - Returns boolean for automatic triggering

2. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Some subtasks marked as dependent on others
   - Helps user sequence work correctly

3. **Time Intelligence**
   - Breaks large blocks into sittable chunks (15-90 min)
   - Includes buffer for unexpected issues
   - Based on research/execute/review pattern

### Example Breakdown

**Input**: "Prepare Q4 board presentation" (180 min)

**AI Output**:
1. ✅ Research key metrics and data (30 min) [research]
2. ✅ Create presentation outline (20 min) [planning] - depends on #1
3. ✅ Design slide templates (45 min) [design] - depends on #2
4. ✅ Fill in content and charts (60 min) [writing] - depends on #3
5. ⚪ Add animations and transitions (15 min) [design, optional] - depends on #4
6. ✅ Review and practice delivery (10 min) [review] - depends on #5

**Total**: 180 minutes across 6 subtasks

### Files Created

- `src/components/ai/AITaskBreakdown.tsx` - Main component (400+ lines)
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/task-breakdown.ts` - Prompt engineering (200+ lines)

---

## 🎨 Integration Points

### AddItemForm Integration

Both features integrated into task creation flow:

```tsx
// Auto-triggers when conditions met
{!isEditMode && shouldAutoDecompose(duration, title) && (
  <AITaskBreakdown ... />
)}

{!isEditMode && isMeeting && (
  <AIMeetingPrep ... />
)}
```

**Visual Design**:
- Purple gradient for task breakdown
- Blue gradient for meeting prep
- Icons for visual distinction
- Descriptive text explains what AI will do
- Buttons use ✨ Sparkles icon for AI magic

---

## 🧠 AI Prompt Engineering

### Meeting Prep Prompt Strategy

- Asks for structured JSON output
- Requests specific number of items (1-3 objectives, 3-5 points)
- Provides confidence scoring based on available context
- Focuses on actionable, specific suggestions
- Includes fallback parsing if JSON fails

**Confidence Factors**:
- High (0.8+): Full context with attendees, description, type
- Medium (0.6-0.8): Some context available
- Low (<0.6): Minimal context, mostly inference

### Task Breakdown Prompt Strategy

- Encourages 3-8 subtask range (manageable, not overwhelming)
- Requests time ranges of 15-90 min per subtask
- Asks for dependency identification
- Suggests common patterns (research → execute → review)
- Returns structured JSON with metadata
- Includes breakdown rationale explanation

**Learning from History** (Future Enhancement):
```typescript
generateBreakdownWithHistory(
  context,
  similarTasks // Past breakdowns for similar tasks
)
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Learning from Usage

Track which subtasks users keep vs. remove to improve future breakdowns:

```typescript
// Track user edits
trackSubtaskChanges({
  originalBreakdown: aiGenerated,
  userFinalSelection: selectedSubtasks,
  taskType: 'presentation',
});

// Use history for better suggestions
const breakdown = await generateWithLearning(context, userHistory);
```

### Common Breakdown Library

Build a library of common task patterns:
- "Presentation" → Research, Outline, Design, Content, Review
- "Blog Post" → Research, Outline, Draft, Edit, Publish, Promote
- "Feature Development" → Spec, Design, Implement, Test, Deploy, Monitor

### Meeting History Integration

Pull from past meeting notes to provide better context:

```typescript
const pastMeetings = await getPastMeetingsWithAttendees(attendees);
const prep = await generateMeetingPrepWithHistory(context, pastMeetings);
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

To measure effectiveness:

1. **Breakdown Acceptance Rate**: % of AI breakdowns users actually use
2. **Subtask Retention**: % of AI subtasks kept vs. deleted
3. **Time Estimate Accuracy**: Actual vs. AI estimated time
4. **Meeting Prep Usage**: % of meetings that use AI prep
5. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on AI suggestions quality

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No batch add**: Currently shows TODO for batch adding subtasks
2. **No history yet**: Doesn't learn from past breakdowns (future feature)
3. **English only**: Prompts are English-centric
4. **Requires OpenAI**: Won't work without API key configured
5. **No persistence**: Meeting prep not saved (just generated on demand)
