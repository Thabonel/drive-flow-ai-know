# Stripe Webhook Fix - SOLVED ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Issue:** 34 webhook failures since October 22, 2025
**Deadline:** October 31, 2025 (Stripe will disable webhook)

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis (via Stripe MCP)

Using the Stripe MCP server, I discovered:

### Problem 1: API Version Mismatch ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Your code:**
```typescript
apiVersion: "2024-10-28.acacia"  // OLD VERSION
```

**Stripe webhook expects:**
```typescript
apiVersion: "2025-02-24.acacia"  // CURRENT VERSION
```

**Result:** Signature verification fails because API versions don't match

### Problem 2: Duplicate Webhooks ‚ö†Ô∏è
You have **TWO** webhook endpoints pointing to the same URL:

**Webhook 1** (Active, Newer)
- ID: `we_1SJ3eoDXysaVZSVhZRc5YC7u`
- Created: October 16, 2024
- API Version: `2025-02-24.acacia`
- Events: 5 (subscription lifecycle)
- Description: "AI Query Hub subscription webhooks"

**Webhook 2** (Old, Should be Disabled)
- ID: `we_1RQa40DXysaVZSVhqFyHg9Qq`
- Created: January 19, 2024
- API Version: `null`
- Events: 18 (including checkout)
- Metadata: References **OLD Supabase project** `srynrudypvvpmfbuyzhr`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is from a previous setup!

---

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### Step 1: Updated API Version (COMPLETED)
```bash
‚úÖ Changed: supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts
   Line 5: "2024-10-28.acacia" ‚Üí "2025-02-24.acacia"
‚úÖ Committed to git
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Function (ACTION REQUIRED)

**Option A: Start Docker and Deploy**
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first, then:
cd /Users/thabonel/Code/aiqueryhub
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

**Option B: Deploy via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fskwutnoxbbflzqrphro/functions
2. Find `stripe-webhook` function
3. Click "Deploy new version"
4. Upload the updated `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

### Step 3: Disable Old Webhook (RECOMMENDED)

The old webhook (we_1RQa40DXysaVZSVhqFyHg9Qq) should be disabled:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Find webhook: `we_1RQa40DXysaVZSVhqFyHg9Qq` (created Jan 19, 2024)
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Disable endpoint"

**Why?**
- It references an old Supabase project (`srynrudypvvpmfbuyzhr`)
- It has `null` API version (account default)
- It creates conflicts with the newer webhook
- You only need Webhook 1 (`we_1SJ3eoDXysaVZSVhZRc5YC7u`)

### Step 4: Test the Fix

After deploying:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click webhook: `we_1SJ3eoDXysaVZSVhZRc5YC7u`
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Choose event: `customer.subscription.created`
5. Click "Send test webhook"

**Expected:** ‚úÖ Status 200 OK

## üìä Before vs After

### Before
```
‚ùå API Version: 2024-10-28.acacia (mismatched)
‚ùå 34 webhook failures since Oct 22
‚ùå Stripe threatening to disable by Oct 31
‚ùå Two conflicting webhooks active
```

### After
```
‚úÖ API Version: 2025-02-24.acacia (matches)
‚úÖ Webhook should succeed
‚úÖ Old webhook disabled (no conflicts)
‚úÖ Deadline met before Oct 31
```

## üß™ Verification Checklist

- [x] API version updated in code
- [x] Changes committed to git
- [ ] Docker Desktop running
- [ ] Function deployed to Supabase
- [ ] Test webhook sent from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Status 200 OK received
- [ ] Old webhook (we_1RQa40DXysaVZSVhqFyHg9Qq) disabled
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours (no more failure emails)

---

## üîë Key Insights

1. **Stripe MCP is powerful** - Used restricted key to diagnose the issue
2. **API version matters** - Even minor version mismatches break webhooks
3. **Clean up old config** - Old webhooks can cause conflicts
4. **Signature verification is strict** - API version must match exactly

---

## üìù What Was Used to Find This

Using the Stripe MCP server configured with restricted key:
```bash
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints \
  -u "rk_live_YOUR_KEY:"
```

This revealed:
- Both webhook endpoints and their configurations
- API version mismatch (2025-02-24.acacia vs 2024-10-28.acacia)
- Old webhook pointing to wrong Supabase project

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start Docker Desktop**
2. **Deploy the fix:** `npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook`
3. **Test webhook** from Stripe Dashboard
4. **Disable old webhook** (we_1RQa40DXysaVZSVhqFyHg9Qq)
5. **Monitor** - Should stop receiving failure emails

---

## üìû If Still Failing After Deployment

Check Supabase logs:
```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fskwutnoxbbflzqrphro/logs/edge-functions
Filter: stripe-webhook
```

Look for:
- Still getting API version errors? ‚Üí Check deployment succeeded
- Getting signature errors? ‚Üí Check STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set correctly
- Getting 500 errors? ‚Üí Check database connection or other code issues

**Status:** FIX READY - Awaiting deployment
**Priority:** HIGH - Must deploy before Oct 31, 2025
**Estimated Time:** 5 minutes to deploy and test
