## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. Error Boundaries (1 day)
**Why**: Prevent single component failures from crashing entire app
**Impact**: Better user experience, graceful degradation
**Effort**: Low

```typescript
// Implement in src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
// Wrap main route components
```

**Implementation**:
- Create error boundary component
- Add fallback UI with retry button
- Wrap each page component in App.tsx
- Optional: Send errors to monitoring service

---

### 2. Rate Limiting on All Endpoints (1 day)
**Why**: Prevent abuse on document upload and sync operations
**Impact**: Cost control, system stability
**Effort**: Low

**Add to**:
- `parse-document`: 20 requests/min
- `google-drive-sync`: 5 requests/5 min
- `microsoft-auth`: 10 requests/min

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Use same pattern as ai-query function
// Supabase edge function middleware
```

---

### 3. Basic Monitoring Setup (2-3 days)
**Why**: Catch issues before users report them
**Impact**: Faster incident response, better reliability
**Effort**: Medium

**Options**:
1. **Sentry Integration** (Recommended)
   - Error tracking for frontend and edge functions
   - Performance monitoring
   - User session replay

2. **Simple Health Check**
   - Create `/health-check` endpoint
   - Monitor with UptimeRobot (free tier)
   - Check database, storage, AI providers

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Install Sentry
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/browser

# Add to main.tsx and edge functions
# Set up alerts for error rate > 5%
```

---

### 4. System Limits Documentation (4 hours)
**Why**: Users need to know quotas and limits
**Impact**: Transparency, better user experience
**Effort**: Very Low

**Document in Settings page or new Limits page**:
- API rate limits
- File size limits
- Storage quotas
- Concurrent operation limits

---

## Medium-Term Improvements (Next 1-3 Months)

### 5. Query Caching (3-4 days)
**Why**: Reduce AI API costs, faster responses
**Impact**: Cost savings at scale, better UX
**Effort**: Medium

**Approach**:
```typescript
// Semantic caching using embeddings
// Cache similar queries (cosine similarity > 0.95)
// 24-hour TTL or invalidate on KB update

interface CachedQuery {
  query_embedding: vector(1536);
  response: string;
  knowledge_base_id: uuid;
  created_at: timestamptz;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 30-50% cost reduction for repeated queries
- Sub-second response time for cache hits
- Reduced load on AI providers

---

### 6. Conversation Management (2 days)
**Why**: Large conversations impact performance
**Impact**: Better performance for power users
**Effort**: Low-Medium

**Features**:
- Warn at 50 messages per conversation
- Suggest new conversation at 100 messages
- Archive conversations older than 90 days
- Optional: Separate messages table for pagination

---

### 7. Automated Backups (1 day + ongoing)
**Why**: 7-day retention may not be enough for critical data
**Impact**: Data safety, compliance
**Effort**: Low

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Weekly backup script via cron
supabase db dump --data-only > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
aws s3 cp backup-*.sql s3://aiqueryhub-backups/

# Keep weekly backups for 90 days
```

---

### 8. Audit Logging (2 days)
**Why**: Track who did what and when
**Impact**: Security, compliance, debugging
**Effort**: Medium

**When needed**: Multi-user admin, enterprise customers

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  action TEXT,
  resource_type TEXT,
  resource_id UUID,
  changes JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

---

## Long-Term Enhancements (3-6 Months)

### 9. Automated Key Rotation (3 days)
**Why**: Security best practice
**Impact**: Reduced risk of key compromise
**Effort**: Medium

**Implementation**:
- Create edge function for key rotation
- Version keys (key_id + created_at)
- Re-encrypt tokens with new keys
- Schedule quarterly rotation via cron

---

### 10. Advanced Analytics (1-2 weeks)
**Why**: Understand user behavior, optimize features
**Impact**: Product insights, better decisions
**Effort**: High

- Document processing times
- AI provider performance

**Tools**:
- PostHog (open source analytics)

- Split by document type

**Frontend**:
- Code splitting for routes
- Image optimization
- Lazy load components

**Database**:

---

### 12. Load Testing (1-2 days)
**Why**: Know system limits before users find them
**Impact**: Confidence in scalability
**Effort**: Low-Medium

**Using k6**:
```javascript
// Test scenarios
// 1. Ramp to 50 concurrent users
// 2. Sustained load for 5 minutes
// 3. Spike test (sudden 100 users)

// Target metrics
// - 95th percentile response < 3s
// - Error rate < 1%
