## Your AI-Powered Productivity Operating System

## What Is AI Query Hub?

AI Query Hub is an intelligent productivity platform that transforms how you work with documents, manage your time, and collaborate with AI. It's not just another document search tool—it's a complete operating system for knowledge workers who want to work smarter, not harder.

Upload your documents. Ask questions in plain English. Get instant, accurate answers drawn from your own knowledge. Then watch as AI helps you plan your day, generate presentations, and automate the tedious parts of your work.

## The Problem We Solve

**Information overload is killing productivity.**

You have documents scattered across Google Drive, Dropbox, and local folders. Finding that one piece of information means opening ten files and scanning through hundreds of pages. You spend more time searching than actually working.

Traditional search gives you links. You still have to read everything yourself.

**AI Query Hub gives you answers.**

Ask "What was the budget we agreed on for Q3?" and get the exact figure—pulled from the right document, with context. Ask "Summarize the key points from last month's board meeting" and get a clear, actionable summary in seconds.

### 2. AI-Powered Conversations

**Ask Anything About Your Documents**

Your AI assistant has read everything. Ask complex questions that span multiple documents:

- "Compare the pricing strategies in our last three proposals"
- "What commitments did we make to clients this quarter?"
- "Find all mentions of Project Alpha and summarize the timeline"

**Persistent Memory**

Unlike other AI tools, your conversations don't disappear. Pick up where you left off. Reference previous discussions. Build on past insights without repeating yourself.

**Multi-Provider Intelligence**

Powered by Claude Opus 4.5—one of the most capable AI models available. Automatic fallback to alternative providers ensures you're never left waiting. Optional offline mode with local AI for sensitive work.

**Web-Connected Research**

When your documents don't have the answer, AI Query Hub searches the web. Get current information, compare with external sources, and stay up-to-date—all within the same conversation.

---

### 3. Timeline & Task Management

**Your Day, Visualized**

A beautiful timeline view shows exactly what's on your plate. Drag tasks to reschedule. See at a glance when you're overbooked. Plan with confidence.

**AI Time Intelligence**

The system learns how long tasks actually take you—not just your estimates. Over time, predictions become remarkably accurate. No more underestimating that "quick" report that always takes three hours.

**Daily Planning Rituals**

Start each day with a guided planning session:
1. Review what you accomplished yesterday
2. Check your calendar commitments
3. Import emails that need action
4. Balance your workload
5. Set your top priorities
6. Begin focused work

Build streaks. Celebrate wins. End each day with a proper shutdown ritual.

**Recurring Tasks & Dependencies**

Set up tasks that repeat on your schedule. Mark tasks that block others. Let the system warn you about bottlenecks before they become problems.

---

### 4. Pitch Deck Generation

**From Documents to Presentations in Minutes**

Select your source documents. Describe what you need. AI Query Hub generates a complete pitch deck with:

- Compelling narrative structure
- AI-generated visuals and images
- Speaker notes for each slide
- Professional formatting

**Presenter & Audience Modes**

Present directly from the platform. Share a link with your audience for synchronized viewing. Control slides with keyboard shortcuts. Auto-advance when you're ready.

**Version Control**

Every iteration is saved. Compare versions. Roll back changes. Never lose a good idea.

---

**Conflict-Free Scheduling**

Get a unique email address. Forward any email to it. AI automatically:

Stop manually copying information from emails into your task list.

Everyone gets the same accurate answers from your shared knowledge. No more "I think the file is somewhere in Drive."

**Delegate with Confidence**
