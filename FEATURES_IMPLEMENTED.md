# New Features Implemented

This document summarizes the three major features that have been added to the AI Query Hub Timeline Manager.

## 🚀 Implementation Complete

All code has been written and committed. The development server is running successfully at **http://localhost:8080**

## ✅ Features Overview

### 1. AI Time Intelligence System

**What it does:**
- Learns from your task completion patterns to provide smarter time estimates
- Automatically tracks actual vs estimated time for every completed task
- Generates insights about your productivity patterns
- Shows AI-powered duration estimates when you create new tasks
- Progressive learning: gets smarter the more you use it

**Key Components:**
- `src/hooks/useAITimeIntelligence.ts` - Main hook for AI estimates
- `src/components/ai/AITimeInsights.tsx` - Insights dashboard
- `src/lib/ai/prompts/time-intelligence.ts` - AI estimation logic
- Database: `time_tracking` table with automatic triggers

**How to use:**
1. Apply migrations (see below)
2. Go to Timeline Manager
3. Create a new task - you'll see AI estimates with confidence badges
4. Complete tasks - the system automatically learns from actual durations
5. Click "AI Insights" button to view productivity analysis

**Learning Stages:**
- **Learning** (< 10 tasks): Low confidence, default estimates
- **Confident** (10-50 tasks): Medium confidence, pattern-based estimates

## 📦 Database Migrations

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**Option 1: One-Click Application**

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fskwutnoxbbflzqrphro/sql
2. Open `apply-all-migrations.sql` in your project root
3. Copy the entire contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run**

**Option 2: Individual Files**

Apply each migration in the `supabase/migrations/` directory in order:
1. `20251102000004_create_day_templates.sql`
2. `20251102000005_seed_system_templates.sql`
3. `20251102000006_create_routine_items.sql`
4. `20251102000007_seed_default_routines.sql`
5. `20251102000008_add_routine_id_to_timeline_items.sql`
6. `20251102000009_create_time_tracking.sql` ← AI Time Intelligence
7. `20251102000010_create_daily_planning.sql` ← Daily Planning
8. `20251102000011_create_booking_links.sql` ← Booking Links

### Verification

After applying migrations, verify in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
  'time_tracking',
  'daily_planning_sessions',
  'daily_planning_settings',
  'booking_links',
  'bookings'
);

-- Should return 5 rows
```
